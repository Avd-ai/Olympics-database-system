# Olympics-database-system

This project is a development of a relational database system in SQL.
The repository has three main components :

A) ERD - entity relationship diagram to explain the design of the database.
B) Code used to implement a database.  
C) Presentation to demonstrate the idea of the project,  how the project was designed , its implementation, and finally the analysis performed.


The phases include 
1) part_1.sql - the creation of a database, tables, along with various columns. 
2) part_2.sql - Creating stored procedures to enable the insertion of data. It includes simple stored procedures, complex stored procedures that refer other tables, and nested stored procedures as well.
3) part_3.sql - The database also has business rules, which put constraints on the data added.
4) part_4.sql - Next, the data is added. Mostly using stored procedures created in part_2.sql file.
5) part_5.sql - Finally, we create a few computed columns, based on the existing columns in a database.
6) After building this database, we run a few queries on this data, fed it to Tableau, and implemented data visualization, show in pdf presentation.

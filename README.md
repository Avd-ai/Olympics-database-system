# Olympics-database-system

This project is a development of a relational database system in SQL.
The repository has two main components :

A) Code used to implement a database.  
B) Presentation to demonstrate the idea of the project,  how the project was designed , its implementation, and finally the analysis performed.

The phases include the creation of a database, tables, along with various columns. 
This is followed by creating stored procedures to enable the insertion of data.
The database also has business rules, which put constraints on the data added.
Next, the data is added.
Finally, we create a few computed columns, based on the existing columns in a database.
